      <p>The <strong>cat</strong> (Felis catus), also called domestic cat and house cat, is a small carnivorous mammal. It is an <em>obligate carnivore</em>, requiring a predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</p>
