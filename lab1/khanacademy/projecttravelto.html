        <p><strong>Paris</strong> isn’t just about the landmarks — it’s about the feeling. The clink of coffee cups on a terrace. The stillness of the <em>Seine</em> at sunrise. The way even a rainy day feels cinematic. With its unmatched art, layered history, and effortless style, Paris is a city you don’t just visit — you feel it.</p>

        <p><strong>Kazakhstan</strong> is the world's ninth-largest country by land area and the largest landlocked country. <em>Hilly</em> plateaus and plains account for nearly half its vast territory, with lowlands composing another third; its southern and eastern frontiers are composed of mountainous regions. Kazakhstan has a population of 20 million and one of the lowest population densities in the world, with fewer than 6 people per square kilometre.</p>

            <li>Enjoy the view of Astana from Bayterek</li>
            <li>Explore Kazakhstan’s spiritual history in Turkestan</li>

        </ol>
        <p><strong>Travel</strong> is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism!</p>
